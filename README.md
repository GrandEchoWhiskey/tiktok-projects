# TikTok Code Repository ðŸŽ¥ðŸ’»
Welcome to the official repository for all the code featured in my TikTok videos! ðŸš€
Here, you'll find well-organized, easy-to-follow code examples, scripts, and projects from my tutorials, experiments, and coding challenges.

What's Inside?
- Topic-Based Folders: Code grouped by video topics like web development, Python tricks, AI/ML projects, or automation scripts.
- Step-by-Step Code: Each folder contains clean, commented code to help you learn and follow along.
- Extras: Occasionally, I'll include bonus content like detailed explanations, alternative solutions, or additional resources.

To start find the right branch and use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
when there is a `requirements.txt` file.

Enjoy!
